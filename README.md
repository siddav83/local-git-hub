# LAP 3 Code Challenge
## Local Github React App
#### Dave && Peter

## Requirements

We are on GitHub a lot! We will make our own repo tracker so we can get an overview of our work without visiting the site itself.
Our design aesthetic is based on a minimalist version of a GitHub repositories page.
We are working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

* The app should make use of React
* The repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
* After submitting their username, the GitHub API should retrieve that userâ€™s list of repos
* When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc. *NB: This usage of the GitHub API does not require authentication*

## Usage
Install packages with `npm install`

Once installed, run the following commands with `npm run`. For example, to run the development script, use `npm run dev`.

* `dev` - Run development
* `build` - Run production build
* `test` - Run all tests
* `coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
